### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiz and I'm the cofounder and CTO of [@prologapp](https://github.com/prologapp).

If you like, you can read about our way of work (only in Portuguese): [https://medium.com/prolog-app](https://medium.com/prolog-app).

Alongside with managing a development team using Scrum, I like to code with those technologies:

Right now, my favorite is ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-informational?style=flat-square&logo=postgresql&logoColor=blue&color=white). The facilities of PostgreSQL continuous to blow my mind day after day so there is no way I cannot love it.

That's it!
